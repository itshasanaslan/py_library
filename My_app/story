At the dawn of a misty night, you are dreaming again. The world you dream is beyond your perceptions.
You see the whole world in a rush.They are always after things urgently. Just like ants.
Then you see how the things are evolved in their hands. You see people are living in peace
and how easy their lives. Families, friendships and other relationships. They are so innocent.
And you see someone who is doing something in the front of
a device. What is that thing. Why he just sits and look at that box for hours and hours. 
Then, you see a massive light beam momentary. Again, again, and again.
Waking up from the dream, you question your life again. Why I always see this illusion.
You try to analyse  things but you never understand. 7 days ago, you woke up under a willow tree; not remembering anything. 
Not even a day, moment, even your name. The only thing you remember since you woke up under the tree that
you are trying to find what happened to you. Actually, you were looking for something which makes you drive insane.Who I am? What's my name...

When you look at your left, you see a river. Then you remember it. You are moving to the river and washing your face.
It gives you a bit relief. But don't satisfies at all. Suddenly, you become uncomfortable. You start to remember things. You are a hunter.
A hunter hunts the monsters. That's why you dressed different. After some time, you take your bag and walk into the forest.

+''He is here!'
{player1.name}"What was that sound?"
+ "Ahh, finally, you are here."
You see a talking monster, which is similar to others you killed before.
{player1.name} "Who are you?"
+"I've been waiting for you. So long...But, but the things have been changed. I will not deliver it before you kill me."
{player1.name} "So let it be."
You draw your weapons quickly.
-----------------------BATTLE-------------
After killing the monster, you see a paper in the ground. You are going to take it slowly. You opened the paper.

{player1.name}: "What the hell is this? Before I kill the monster, he told me something. Perhaps, this was the thing he was
supposed to deliver to me. I need to find what this text means."
You put the paper to your pocket and then move on. You still can't figure out what was just happened between you and the monster.
The way he behave was so different. 

CHAPTER 2














Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you. In the end,you realize, the real monster is, OURSELVES...    from {encrypted_name}
